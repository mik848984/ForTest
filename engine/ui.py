"""Small UI helpers based on an immediate mode approach.

The real project would make use of the `nuklear` Python bindings to display UI
widgets.  Shipping the full dependency is unnecessary for the unit tests, so
this module implements just enough to render a score and highâ€‘score counter on a
pygame surface.  The API intentionally mirrors a tiny subset of what a Nuklear
interface might look like so game code can be written in a similar style.
